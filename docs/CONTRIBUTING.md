# Contributing

Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/AREA44/jekyll-ex/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/AREA44/jekyll-ex/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.


### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`).
3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe the feature or fix.

## Development

To build this theme, you need install `jekyll`. For more information, see [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
